## Description
I built this project to practice both using the inquirer library as well as the fs library from node.
This allows someone to dynamically create an html file from inquirer inputs. Basically, someone with little to no knowledge of web development could create their own html file for listing employees and their information.
I learned a lot about promises (got a lot of practice with that). I also got a fair bit of practice using classes and constructors.
